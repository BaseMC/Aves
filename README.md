### [Building](docs/Building.md)

### Why?
This project is designed for quickly inspecting new game versions.

The generated code is not perfect, but it's readable and that's what it's meant for.

No need to wait for someone to release new mappings or a version.

The project trys to work as automated as possible.<br/>
So if Mojang doesn't do any (breaking) changes, it should work a long time :t-rex:
